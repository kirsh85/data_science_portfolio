# Web scraping


## Description

I used Trip Advisor for my scraping project. I searched hotels in Cape Town and scraped Hotel Names, Ratings and Reviews from each hotel. I used Scrapy to write the spider to crawl the trip advisor website. This project was purely acedemic to  understand and practice scraping.

### Scrapy

 the tripadvisor folder contains the contents of the spider, items and pipelines. The data file produced from the scrapy scripts can be found at: "reviews.csv". 


### Shiny App

 TripAdvisorViz: an RShiny app showing some analysis from the data that was scraped. The results of the app is at:
