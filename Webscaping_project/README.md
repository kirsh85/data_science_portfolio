# Web scraping


## Description

Using [Trip Advisor](https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/),  I wanted to find information on hotels in Cape Town.  Scraping each of their Ratings and Reviews. I used Scrapy to write the spider to crawl the trip advisor website. This project was purely acedemic to  understand and practice scraping.

### Scrapy

 the [tripadvisor folder](https://github.com/kirsh85/data_science_portfolio/Websraping_project/tripadvisor/) contains the contents of the spider, items and pipelines. 

### Data
 The data file produced from the scrapy scripts can be found at: "reviews.csv". 


### Shiny App

 TripAdvisorViz: an RShiny app showing some analysis from the data that was scraped. The results of the app is at:
