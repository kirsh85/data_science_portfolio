# Web scraping

 I used Trip Advisor for my scraping project. I searched hotels in Cape Town and scraped Hotel Names, Ratings and Reviews from each hotel. I used Scrapy to write the spider to crawl the trip advisor website. This project was purely acedemic to  understand and practice scraping. 
 In this folder:
 tripadvisor/ : contents of the spider, items and pipelines.  
 reviews.csv: the data file produced from the scrapy scripts.  
 TripAdvisorViz: an RShiny app showing some analysis from the data that was scraped. The results of the app is at:
