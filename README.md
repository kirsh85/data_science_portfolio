# Data Science Portfolio


This repository is a collection of a few projects I have worked on. The projects are either written in R, RShiny, Python or D3.js. I use data science techniques to explore some interesting data or for my own learning and discovery. Click on the projects to see analysis and code.

## projects
#### [exploring bank visits](https://github.com/kirsh85/data_science_portfolio/tree/master/exploring_bank_visits)

- Using Nathan Yau's Day in the life of an American' tutorial to create clusters moving in D3.js 
- Data wrangling was done in R and then the cleaned data transferred to D3.
- I created the nodes to move in groups at time intervals to various positions.
